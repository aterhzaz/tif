Welcome to Talend Integration Factory!
=====================================

Talend Integration Factory (TIF) is a fully supported, stable, 
production ready distribution based on the industry leading open source 
integration framework Apache Camel. Apache Camel uses well known 
Enterprise Integration Patterns to make message based system 
integration simpler yet powerful and scalable. 

The Apache Camel uses a lightweight, component based architecture 
which allows a great flexibility in deployment scenarios: as stand-alone
JVM applications or embedded in a servlet container such as Tomcat,
or within a JEE server, or in an OSGi container such as Equinox.  

Apache Camel and TIF come out of the box with an impressive set 
of available components for all commonly used protocols like 
http, https, ftp, xmpp, rss and many more. A large number of data
formats like EDI, JSON, CSV, HL7 and languages like JS, Python, 
Scala, are supported out of the box. Its extensible architecture
allows developers to easily add support to proprietary protocols
and data formats.

The TIF distribution supplements the Apache Camel with support for 
OSGi containers, support for integrating Talend jobs on Camel routes
and a number of advanced examples.
The OSGi container uses Apache Karaf. It's a lightweight container
providing advanced features such as provisioning, hot deployment,
logger system, dynmamic configuration, complete shell environment, etc.
It's profesional and production ready kernel for the TIF.

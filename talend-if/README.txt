Talend Integration Factory Container - powered by Karaf
===============================================================================

The Talend Integration Factory Container (aka TIF Container) is a lightweight OSGi container powered by Apache Karaf.
It packs current versions of Equinox, Camel and CXF. The Container already contains everything needed to run Camel
routes and CXF services. Still it is very compatible to the pure Karaf distribution.


Starting TIF Container
======================

The start scripts are in the container/bin directory. If you loaded the .zip version you will see Windows starters, for the .tar.gz version you will see Linux/Unix starters.

Scripts (use .bat extension for Windows):

 - tif : Launch the container in foreground with the TIF (Karaf) console
 - karaf : same as tif
 - server:  Start TIF Container in background:
 - client <command> : Connect to running Container and start shell command <command>
 
 At this point the examples can be run. Please refer to the README in each example for further instructions


Short introduction to TIF and Karaf
===========================

Make sure to read the Karaf getting started:
http://karaf.apache.org/manual/2.2.1-SNAPSHOT/quick-start.html

> list

   Shows the list of installed bundles. -s will show the bundle symbolic name instead of the description
   
> start <id>

   Start the bundle with the given id

> stop <id>

   Stop the bundle with the given id

> features:listurl

   Shows the features.xml files that are available. These define which features can be installed

> features:install <feature>

   Install a given feature. A feature contains bundles, config and references to other features. They are an easy way to do complex 
   installations with one command

> ls

   Show the available OSGi services
   

Hints
====

Use <tab> for quick entry completion, it is available for most commands.

Use "| grep -i <searchstring>" to filter interesting information from long lists.

TIF Container (Karaf) is very silent. Make sure to have a tail -f on the log running to not miss exceptions and warnings.

The container will keep its state after restarts. So to really reset the container delete the data directory.

Interested how a features.xml at mvn:org.apache.karaf.assemblies.features/standard/2.2.0/xml/features looks? Try "cat mvn:org.apache.karaf.assemblies.features/standard/2.2.0/xml/features"

Use the environment variable KARAF_DEBUG=true to prepare the container for a remote debugging session. Connect to it using the Eclipse "Remote Java Application" starter.
